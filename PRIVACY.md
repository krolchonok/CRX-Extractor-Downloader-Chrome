# Privacy Policy

Date: January 31, 2026

## Summary
This extension does not collect or transmit personal data. All operations run locally in your browser, except direct requests to official extension store servers to download CRX files.

## Data Used
- Active tab URL and page title — only to detect the extension ID and build the download filename.
- Files you choose (local `.crx`) — only for local conversion to `.zip`.

## Data Not Collected
- No personal data is collected, stored, or shared.
- No analytics, trackers, ad SDKs, or third-party pixels are used.

## Network Requests
The extension only contacts official store endpoints to download CRX files:
- `https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx`
- `https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx`

No other network requests or data transfers are performed.

## Permissions
- `downloads` — save files to disk.
- `contextMenus` — add items to the page context menu.
- `activeTab` — read the active tab URL/title to detect the extension ID.
- `host_permissions` — allow access to the official CRX download endpoints.

## Contact
If you have privacy questions, contact the developer through the extension’s store listing.
